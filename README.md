## Description

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

We are provided with the code for a restaurant reviews website and are expected to either improve on it or discard it and start afresh so as to achieve an app that is not only dynamic and accessible but also user friendly on many various devices and also it be able to work offline. Our job is to update the code to resolve all the issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Prerequsite
* Python (little or good experience) is required
* A good knowledge of web accessibilty is required
* UI/UX knowledge
* Mobile or Desktop devices

### Installation

1. Download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository onto your local workstation:
*  https://github.com/Bobobeehood/Restaurant-Review-App

2. Open a browser window and navigate to the index.html file in your application's directory:
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
